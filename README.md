# STA 380 Project

A cumulative effort to solve various problems using machine learning.

## Getting Started

The problem statement has 6 questions. Raw code can be found in the STA 380 Final.Rmd file.     

Required files are attached :
* ReutersC50
* ABIA.csv
* greenbuildings.csv
* groceries.txt
* social_marketing.csv

## Problem Statements:

Green Buildings - An Austin real-estate developer is interested in the possible economic impact of "going green" in her latest project: a new 15-story mixed-use building on East Cesar Chavez, just across I-35 from downtown.  Will investing in a green building be worth it, from an economic perspective?

Portfolio Modeling - In this problem, you will construct three different portfolios of exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, and use bootstrap resampling to analyze the short-term tail risk of your portfolios. 

Market Segmentation - This was data collected in the course of a market-research study using followers of the Twitter account of a large consumer brand that shall remain nameless---let's call it "NutrientH20" just to have a label.  The goal here was for NutrientH20 to understand its social-media audience a little bit better, so that it could hone its messaging a little more sharply. 

Author Attribution - Use the Reuters C50 corpus.  Your task is to build the best model you can, using any combination of tools you see fit, for predicting the author of an article on the basis of that article's textual content. 

Association Rule Mining - see the data on grocery purchases in groceries.txt and find some interesting association rules for these shopping baskets. Pick your own thresholds for lift and confidence; just be clear what these thresholds are and how you picked them. Do your discovered item sets make sense? Present your discoveries in an interesting and concise way. 


The final output is in STA 380 Final.md and STA 380 Final.pdf (pdf if there is some issue with viewing in md format)
